  "steps": [
    "Project Nebula has some important rules to follow:\n\n1. We write our code in a special language called ZYTHON-X.\n2. All ZYTHON-X files end with the .zx extension.\n3. Whenever we write 120 lines of code, we need to have a code review done.\n4. To fix any bugs in our code, we use a tool called NebulaScope.\n5. We are only allowed to deploy (make our code live) on Fridays, and it must be between 6 PM and 8 PM."
